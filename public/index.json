[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD student in Lynne Quarmby\u0026rsquo;s Lab at Simon Fraser University Dept. Molecular Biology and Biochem.\nMy PhD project focusses on understanding the snow algae microbiome at the micro and macro level. Under the microscope, we see a stunning diversity of shapes and colors of snow algae, but we still are not able to identify the majority of these. To resolve this I am using single-cell approaches to link morphology with genetics, to uncover the diversity in snow algae blooms and lay foundations for understanding their life history. At the planetary level, snow algae blooms cause massive pink blooms on snow, causing the snow to melt faster, but we still do not know how widespread these blooms are, where they occur, and whether they are increasing due to climage change. To address these questions I am using remote sensing and machine learning to automate detection of blooms, and map their spatio-temporal distribution.\nInterests include microbial ecology, genomics, remote sensing, data science, statistics. Outside of research, I spend my time climbing and exploring the Coast Mountains near my home in Squamish, BC.\n  Download my CV.\nThis blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, and deployed using Netlify.

To train the computer algorithms we need to ground data. You can help by going out and classifying points as either ‘algae’ or ‘other’ (along with a photo to confirm that you actually visited the point), which we will then use to train and validate the classifier. We can then use the classifier to automatically detect snow algae in satellite imagery.\nStep-by-step  Sign up in advance (link to google forms)   Todo: forms waiver May take a few days for us to add you as a participant  Visit the web app (link)   Download points for the region you will visit Do this less than 7 days before you go into the field to get the most recent imagery Points are generated based on most recent satellite imagery  Import points into Gaia   Visit gaiagps.com Import points Important: Share the points with casey.engstrom@gmail.com  Set up mobile app   Download mobile gaia GPS app on the app store. The points should sync automatically  Visit points in field   At as many points as possible Click on point, take photo, set title as “Algae” if you would like to classify as algae, set title as “Other” if you would like to classify as other. Photo shows the pink snow, or if the snow is dirty, or clean Write notes as desired (e.g. dirty snow) Best judgement when choosing which points to visit! The points are generated by a simple algorithm that knows nothing about potential mountain hazards. (link)  Sync data once back in service   Will update the shared points  We will include your data in a list of classified points to train our algorithm to recognize snow algae blooms in satellite imagery. The results can be viewed at the Snow Algae Atlas (link).\n","date":1620691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620759553,"objectID":"c5bf152914ddf10f95b77167b452707c","permalink":"https://caseyengstrom.com/post/volunteer-instructions/","publishdate":"2021-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/volunteer-instructions/","section":"post","summary":"Print or save these instructions before going into the field Overview We can detect snow algae in satellite imagery using machine learning.
