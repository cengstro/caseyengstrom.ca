Snow algae blooms color the snow pink and cause the snow to melt faster. We still do not know how widespread these blooms are, where they occur, and whether they are increasing due to climage change. To address these questions I am using remote sensing to map the spatio-temporal distribution, both to better understand their biogeography and quanitfy their effect on albedo. When we look at red snow wnder the microscope, we see a stunning diversity of shapes and colors. To determine whether these cells are distinct species, or different life stages of the same species I am using single-cell sequencing to explore microbiome diversity.\nBroadly, my research interests include microbial ecology, genomics, remote sensing, data science, and statistics.

The melting snow provides liquid water that supports blooms of microscopic algae, but to photosynthesize on the snow these algae are not green but instead color the snow brilliant hues of red, pink, and orange. The snow algae support a diverse microbiome, including microscopic grazers, parasitic fungi, and symbiotic bacteria. Fascinating in their own right, this microbiome is also important for it\u0026rsquo;s role in the broader ecosystem: the algae \u0026ldquo;eat away\u0026rdquo; at the snow. The algae darkens the snow surface, absorbing more solar energy and melting pockets of snow around it like holes in Swiss cheese.\nSnow algae could play a vital role in mountain ecosystems by regulating the speed of snow melt, like \u0026ldquo;ecosystem engineers\u0026rdquo; that control the water flow downstream. The timing of snowmelt impacts plant phenology in alpine meadows, and provides water throughout the summer for habitats along the river. Glacial runoff cools the water temperature for salmon, and transports nutrients that fuel the base of the oceanic food web. For humans, the summer snowpack supplies water for irrigation and reservoirs, and early meltout can tip the scales towards drought and wildfire. Snow is an excellent reflective surface, so loss of snow cover means more solar energy is absorbed, resulting in more global warming in a positive feedback loop.\nWe still don\u0026rsquo;t know how widespread or frequent these blooms are, or whether they are increasing with climate change. As part of my PhD project I am using satellite imagery to map the distribution of snow algae blooms. I was shocked to see entire ranges with glaciers almost completely covered in pink snow.\nHowever, satellite images can be deceptive, and other things can also cause the snow to look pink: mineral dust, alpenglow, or ash from wildfires. Before we can make a snow algae map, we need to identify which pink snow is actually algae. I trained a random forest classifier to distinguish between snow cover types by visual interpretation, essentially my \u0026ldquo;best guess\u0026rdquo;, but without ground validation we don\u0026rsquo;t know how accurate this classifier really is.\nThis summer, hikers and mountaineers can help validate our satellite map by visiting predicted snow algae locations. It works like this: a few days before your trip, check our web app to see if there are any active points in that region. In the field, visit points with the Gaia GPS app, take a photo, and classify the snow cover.\nIf you like to spend time in the mountains, please consider joining our citizen science project.

Volunteers get a free 1-year Gaia GPS Premium membership.\nShort Version   Download predicted snow algae points from current imagery for your region  Import points into Gaia GPS and share folder Hike to points and classify them as either \u0026ldquo;Algae\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; Sync data  Long Version First, sign up. You only need do this once.\n1. Download predicted snow algae points A few days before your trip, visit the Point Finder Google Earth Engine app. Try and do this immediately before your trip\u0026mdash;ideally within a day or two before you leave, so you get the most recent satellite imagery (~weekly flyover).\n(1a) Center the map around the area you plan to visit, and click \u0026lsquo;Get Points\u0026rsquo;.\nThis searches your region for recent, cloud-free satellite imagery. If any is found, it searches that image for red snow, and applies machine learning to predict whether the red snow is snow algae or something else (e.g. mineral dust on snow surface). Red points are predicted snow algae, blue points are predicted \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo;.\nThis may generate as many as several hundred points\u0026mdash;we don\u0026rsquo;t expect you to visit them all! Visit as many as safely and reasonably possible. Even just one point provides us with valuable data. Between 10 and 20 is reasonable for a day trip. Ideally, we would like you to visit an even number of red and blue points\u0026ndash;especially red points.\nIf no images or points appear, don\u0026rsquo;t give up! Try another region, or check back in a week or so to see if any new imagery is available.\n(1b) Click \u0026lsquo;Download points link\u0026rsquo; to download the points. A pop-up will ask you where to save them to.\n2. Import points into Gaia GPS Visit the Gaia GPS website. If this is your first time, click \u0026lsquo;Sign Up For Free\u0026rsquo;, and use the same email you used to sign up for the project. Note: it may take a few days after you sign up for us to activate your free Gaia Premium subscription.\n(2a) Once you\u0026rsquo;ve logged into the Gaia GPS website, on the left menu click \u0026lsquo;Import Data\u0026rsquo;, then \u0026lsquo;Select Files\u0026rsquo;, then navigate to where you saved the points.\n(2b) The points will pop up on the map. Click the green \u0026lsquo;Save __ items\u0026rsquo; button to upload the points to Gaia Cloud. (Note: you may get a \u0026lsquo;Large file import\u0026rsquo; warning message if your file contains many points. Click the box and click Import and proceed.)\n(2c) In the top right drop-down menu, navigate to \u0026lsquo;Folders\u0026rsquo;.\n(2d) Your most recent upload should be at the top of the list (.geojson). Click on the title to view folder contents.\n(2e) Scroll down to find the \u0026lsquo;Share This Folder\u0026rsquo; options on the right panel. Enter my email casey.engstrom (at) gmail.com, and click the \u0026lsquo;Share\u0026rsquo; button below.\nImportant: Please share the folder as described above. Otherwise, we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to see the data you collect.\n(2f) Check that the points have sync\u0026rsquo;d on your Gaia GPS smartphone app.\nIf this is your first time, download Gaia GPS from your smartphone app store, and log in using the same credentials you used for the Gaia GPS website.\nIn the Gaia phone app, navigate in the map to the region you plan to visit. Your points should appear same as on the Gaia website.\n(2g) If the points don\u0026rsquo;t appear, check the account is set to automatically sync. In the bottom \u0026lsquo;Settings\u0026rsquo; menu, click \u0026lsquo;Account\u0026rsquo;, make sure the slider for Sync With GaiaCloud is green. Click the grey box where it says Last Sync to force a sync now.\n3. Hike to points and classify If this is your first time, we reccommend downloading this page on your phone for reference in the field.\nVisit points along your route using Gaia GPS blue-dot navigation. Exercise best judgement, do not visit a point if it feels unsafe for any reason! Try and visit an equal number or red and blue points\u0026ndash; red points are in short supply.\nUpon arrival to a point, have a look at the snow within a ~5 m radius of where you stand. Is the snow visibly pink? Or does it just look dirty?\nThe bright pink stuff in the above photo is definitely snow algae.\n(3a) Click the point, then click the the little green (i) button to edit the point. Use camera button to enter photography mode. Take a photo that you think is representative of the nearby snow surface (see above for examples).\n(3d) Once you have clicked \u0026ldquo;Use this photo\u0026rdquo;, a pop-up will ask you to title the photo. Write \u0026lsquo;Algae\u0026rsquo; if the snow is predominantly pink snow algae, \u0026lsquo;Dirt\u0026rsquo; if mostly dirt, \u0026lsquo;White\u0026rsquo; if the snow is just white, or \u0026lsquo;Other\u0026rsquo; if something else. You can also write \u0026lsquo;Mix\u0026rsquo; if there is a mix of snow algae and dirt, or \u0026lsquo;Unsure\u0026rsquo; if you don\u0026rsquo;t know. Optionally provide more details in the Notes section. Save.\n(3e) Navigate back to the map, and click on the point again (the little green (i) button) to make sure the photo and title are attached. You should see a photo thumbnail next to the camera button, and the title should appear at the top.\n(3f) Repeat 3a - 3d to visit as many points as reasonably and safely possible.\nBe aware of mountain hazards, and practice Leave No Trace. Remember, we don\u0026rsquo;t expect you to visit all points, likely many points will not be accessible! Even just one point provides us with valuable data, and between 10 and 20 is reasonable for a day trip. Again, if possible visit an even number of red and blue points\u0026mdash;especially red points.\n4. Sync data upon return Visit gaiagps.com and click a few points to ensure that your data was properly sync\u0026rsquo;d.\nIf not, check the sync settings in your phone app. See (2g) above.\nThank you for participating, be safe, and have fun!\n","date":1622419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622512203,"objectID":"b6517570660ba04c3d28b071c7e386e8","permalink":"https://caseyengstrom.ca/blog/volunteer-protocol/","publishdate":"2021-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/volunteer-protocol/","section":"blog","summary":"The Snow Algae Atlas aims to map the distribution of snow algae worldwide using satellite imagery.
