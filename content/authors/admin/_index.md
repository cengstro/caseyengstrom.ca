Hi! I'm Casey. I recently (as of Sept 2023) completed a PhD studying snow algae in Lynne Quarmby's lab in the Dept. Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Simon Fraser University. My research interests include remote sensing, ecology, and climate. Check out my [pubs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aST1ItMAAAAJ&hl=en) to learn more. I am happy to share my research, don't hesitate to send me an email casey_engstrom [at] sfu.ca
