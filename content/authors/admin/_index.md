I am a 5th year PhD student in [Lynne Quarmby's Lab](https://www.quarmby.ca) at [Simon Fraser University Dept. Molecular Biology and Biochemistry](https://www.sfu.ca/mbb). I study red snow algal blooms at both macro and micro scales, using remote sensing to understand their distribution, effect on snowmelt, and response to global warming, and genomics to understand their species composition (and discover new species!). Broadly, my research interests include microbial ecology, genomics, remote sensing, data science, and statistics. I enjoy climbing and exploring the Coast Mountains near my home in Squamish, BC.
